# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this analysis was to explore Unsupervised Machine Learning models. We created a report that would include what cryptocurrencies were being traded on the market and grouped by a classification system for a new investment. 

We started by the standard machine learning model data preprocessing proces and proceeded to reduce data dimensions using PCA. We then used a K-Means algorithm to predict K clusters for the cryptocurrencies' data. 

Using charts and graphs, we created an elbow curve graph, and we were also able to create a scatter plot and 3D scatter plot graphs to further visualize our findings.
